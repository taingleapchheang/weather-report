# Optional Enhancements

## Goal

Optional enhancements are meant to spark our imagination! They can give us extra ideas for how to extend this project. Optional enhancements should never compromise the project requirements, unless there are special circumstances.

## Optional Means Optional

It is more important and more valuable to do good work with the requirements, and to solidify your learning. Please do not work on optional enhancements before feeling confident in the project requirements.

## Prompts

- Create a button to convert the temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- Changing the temperature should change the page's background.
- Changing the sky should change the page's background.
- Include transitions and animations for any appearance change.
- Customize the theme of your app to something other than a landscape and sky (while retaining the same functionality).
- Deploy/host your project onto the Internet
    - If you deploy your *Weather Report web app*, you will also need to deploy the *Weather Report proxy server*.
    - We recommend deploying to GitHub Pages.
    - We encourage you to do some of your own research and then review [our resource on deploying to GitHub Pages using `parcel-bundler`](./deploy.md) as needed.
