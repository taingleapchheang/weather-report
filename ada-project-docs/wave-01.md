# Wave 1: Create Wireframes and HTML

## Wireframes

Before writing code, create a set of diagrams, sketches, or low-fidelity wireframes to visualize your project's layout.

These wireframes should include all the required HTML elements.

If possible, share and talk through ideas with someone else!

Use these wireframes to guide the rest of your project.

## HTML

We recommend you get started by writing the HTML in `index.html`.

You will need to link:
- `index.css` 
- `index.js`   
- `./node_modules/axios/dist/axios.min.js` 

## Tips

- This project will require you to select _a lot_ of elements. Creating logical, well-organized HTML structures in the beginning will help you later on.
- Create as many `id`s as you need. Sometimes, it's more effective to select by ID, compared to selecting by class, element, or relationship.
- To get a little more error reporting help from the browser, we can request [strict behavior](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode). To turn this behavior on, add the literal string `"use strict";` to the top of your `index.js` file.
