# Wave 3: Naming the City

As mentioned before, there are two required elements:

- An element that displays a city name
- A [text input element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/text) that allows the user to change the city name

## Requirements

The city name must update every time there's a change to the text input element.

For example, if the text input element has the characters `Seatt` in it, then the displayed city name should be "Seatt."

## Hints

- This feature requires you to grab the _value_ of the text input element.
