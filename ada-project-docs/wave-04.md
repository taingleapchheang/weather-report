# Wave 4: Calling APIs

For this wave, we will add a feature that gets the weather of the currently displayed city name. 

We should add a `<button>` element that when clicked updates and displays the realtime temperature of the currently displayed city name.

## LocationIQ and OpenWeather

In order to get the weather of the city, we will need to get the latitude and longitude of the city using the [`LocationIQ`](https://locationiq.com/docs) API. We can then use the latitude and longitude with the [`OpenWeather`](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) API to get current weather data. 

To get started and generate API tokens, create accounts andÂ log into `LocationIQ` and `OpenWeather`.

## Weather Report Proxy Server

For Weather Report, we provide a [weather report proxy server](https://github.com/adaGold/weather-report-proxy-server) built with Flask. 

As such, the *Weather Report web app* we are building should make `axios` calls to our *Weather Report proxy server*, which manages our `LocationIQ` and `OpenWeather` API keys and forwards our requests along to the appropriate 3rd party API. 

For details on how to run the Weather Report proxy server, see the [Weather Report Proxy Server README](https://github.com/adaGold/weather-report-proxy-server). No changes need to be made to the source code of the proxy server. The only work that needs to be done is adding a `.env` file with your API keys.

While the `GET` requests to `LocationIQ` and `OpenWeather` are already implemented in the proxy server, we should still read the [`LocationIQ`](https://locationiq.com/docs) and [`OpenWeather`](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) docs to learn how to build the request and parse the response.

*Note: VSCode may try to be "helpful" and add a `require` call: `const { default: axios } = require("axios");` This will cause an error and should be removed.*

### Proxy Servers

When we are building client side web applications, we don't want to include our API keys in our code as they will be available for anyone to see. To manage our API keys we will use a proxy server.

"A proxy server is a server (or computer system or an application) that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers" [resource](https://medium.com/system-design-blog/what-is-proxy-server-a05b99bf686a#:~:text=A%20proxy%20server%20is%20a,seeking%20resources%20from%20other%20servers). 

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

The Weather Report Proxy server uses the package [`flask-cors`](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to handle Cross Origin Resource Sharing.

    <summary>Expand to see the <code>__init__.py</code> file for the proxy server</summary>

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_cors import CORS


def create_app(test_config=None):
    app = Flask(__name__)
    CORS(app)
    app.config['CORS_HEADERS'] = 'Content-Type'

    from .routes import proxy_bp
    app.register_blueprint(proxy_bp)

    return 
```

CORS will continue to come up as we move into learning Full Stack development. To learn more about CORS, a great place to start is the [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS). Follow your curiosity!
