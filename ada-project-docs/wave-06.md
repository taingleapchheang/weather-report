# Wave 6: Resetting the City Name

Include a button that resets the city name.

When a user clicks on this button, the city name will be set to a default name.

## Hints

For best results, this reset button should also affect the city name text input element.

For the best user experience, the text input element's value should be set to the default city name, or become blank.
